This is the second article on Infrastructure as Code using well-known programming languages. [The first one](https://kubesandclouds.com/index.php/2020/07/13/aws-cdk-dev-like-iac/) was focused on the AWS CDK. In this post, we will introduce Pulumi, a similar tool which offers multi-cloud support.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is one of the biggest revolutions in the cloud computing landscape, as it allows automating the deployment of infrastructure based on its definition in the source code. Using code as the source of truth for infrastructure has several benefits:

- Infrastructure can be versioned as source code normally is, increasing the traceability of the infrastructure deployed.
- Deployments, rollbacks and disaster recovery procedures can be easily automated, reducing the amount of human intervention, thus reducing the likelihood of errors.
- Costs are reduced, as resources can be easily resized to adapt them to the load fluctuations and environments can be switched off when they are not needed.
- Deployment processes are sped up significantly, making the software development lifecycle more efficient, as environments can be deployed when needed.

IaC can be implemented by means of several tools, being Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Chef or Puppet some of the most widely used ones. These tools normally rely on declarative languages (or dialects) using mostly YAML, JSON and JSON-like formatting for the infrastructure definition. Getting to work with these languages and tools can be challenging sometimes, specially for those with a more ‚ÄòDeveloper-like‚Äô background.

Thus, it makes sense to deploy infrastructure using high-level languages, which are more natural to developers. This approach can increase productivity based on the fact that common development patterns can be easily reused. This way of working, enables developers to provision infrastructure easily, without needing to be an infrastructure expert. Besides, developers can provision a complete stack, applications and the underlying infrastructure, by using high-level languages in their IDE of choice. This is particularly useful in medium size and small companies and projects, where just one team is in charge of the management and operation of both the Dev and Ops parts.

Pulumi overview by [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)

In this post, Pulumi will be introduced and reviewed. Pulumi is an open source development framework which helps creating and managing cloud infrastructure and applications by using well-known programming languages such as Typescript, Javascript, Python, Go and C#.

For the examples analyzed in this article, python was the language chosen, deploying infrastructure using different public cloud providers. You can find the code used to create the examples that are shown in this post in the [Pulumi examples repository](https://github.com/pulumi/examples).

* * *

## Setting Pulumi up‚öôÔ∏è

The first step is to install Python 3, specifically Python 3.6 or later versions. You can get Python 3 latest version for your OS [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once Python 3 is installed, the next step will be getting Pulumi installed in your machine. For Linux distributions, issue the following command. For other OSs, you can find the installation steps [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/begin/#install-pulumi).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
```

In order to use Pulumi in your command line, you will need to sign up into [the Pulumi console](https://app.pulumi.com/signin), so that your stack's state can be persisted. Don't worry, as it's free for personal use, and you can use either your GitLab, GitHub or Atlassian accounts as well as your email address to sign up.

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-1.59.26-PM-1024x513.png)

Once you are registered, it is time to generate an access token, as the CLI will ask for one in order to have access to your account and store the stack information.

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.00.37-PM-1024x377.png)

Finally, issue the following command and paste the access token you have just generated in the step before. If everything went well, you should see a similar output to the one shown in the image below.

```bash
pulumi login
```

## Project structureüîñ¬†

If you were to create your first project on your own, you would have to create a directory and issue the following commands, specifying the cloud provider to use and the language to code with.

```bash
mkdir test-project
cd test-project
pulumi new <provider>-<language>
```

The Pulumi CLI would guide you through a simple setup process, where several parameters can be specified, such as the project name, its description, the stack name and the AWS region where it is to be deployed. **However, keep in mind that for the examples in this article, pre-configured projects are used, thus, you don't really have to follow this setup procedure, it's just an indication in case you want to develop you own project from scratch.**

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-12.20.21-AM.png)

After setting up the project (a Python one in this case), the files present in the directory are the ones shown in the image below. **Pulumi.yaml** and **Pulumi.dev.yaml** are the project and stack configuration files respectively, whereas **\_\_main\_\_.py** is the Python program which defines the stack. The file **requirements.txt** contains the dependencies needed for the stack to work, and the **venv** directory is a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), which contains all the executables and libraries needed to use the Packages imported in the Python project.

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-12.26.39-AM.png)

The following snippet shows the contents of a **Pulumi.yaml** file. In order to make Pulumi work, at least name and runtime need to be defined. Under _template.config_, required values for the stack to work can be defined.

```yaml
name: aws-py-eks
runtime: python
description: A minimal AWS Python EKS example cluster
template:
  config:
    aws:region:
      description: The AWS region to deploy into
      default: us-east-2
```

* * *

## Deploying the Stack

To test Pulumi on different cloud providers, we will be using the [Pulumi examples repository](https://github.com/pulumi/examples). Clone it to your machine using git to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pulumi/examples.git
cd examples
```

* * *

### AWS‚òÅÔ∏èüî∂¬†

Prior to the deployment, you will need to configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI (you can get the AWS CLI [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)). In order to do so, you will need an AWS secret key and access key pair. If you don‚Äôt have one yet, you can create a new one in the AWS IAM console. Check¬†[this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)¬†as a guide.

```bash
aws configure
```

Keep in mind that the user which uses those credentials should have permissions to create the infrastructure specified in the code. For this example you can use the¬†**AdministratorAccess**¬†managed policy. Store well your credentials, and once this user is no longer needed, remove it, to avoid unnecessary risks.

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-07-at-3.06.05-PM-1024x393-1.png)

For AWS we will be using the [EKS python example](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-py-eks). This example contains three main files: **\_\_main\_\_.py**, **iam.py** and **vpc.py**, which define respectively the EKS cluster, its associated IAM roles and policies and the VPC and networking resources needed to launch the instances on. The snippet below shows the contents of **\_\_main\_\_.py** , which defines a two-worker EKS cluster. Take your time to give a read to the different files which make up the entire example, so that you can have a general idea of the entire stack.

```python
import iam
import vpc
import pulumi
from pulumi_aws import eks

## EKS Cluster

eks_cluster = eks.Cluster(
    'eks-cluster',
    role_arn=iam.eks_role.arn,
    tags= {'Name':'pulumi-eks-cluster'},
    vpc_config = {
        'publicAccessCidrs': ['0.0.0.0/0'],
        'security_group_ids': [vpc.eks_security_group.id],
        'subnet_ids': vpc.subnet_ids,
    }
)

eks_node_group = eks.NodeGroup(
    'eks-node-group',
    cluster_name=eks_cluster.name,
    node_group_name='pulumi-eks-nodegroup',
    node_role_arn=iam.ec2_role.arn,
    subnet_ids=vpc.subnet_ids,
    tags={
        'Name' : 'pulumi-cluster-nodeGroup'
    },
    scaling_config = {
        'desired_size': 2,
        'max_size': 2,
        'min_size': 1,
  },
)

pulumi.export('cluster-name', eks_cluster.name)
```

You will find the files for this example within the **aws-py-eks** directory.

```bash
cd aws-py-eks/
```

Create the virtual environment and activate it. After doing so, install the packages specified in **requirements.txt**.

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the python stuff is ready, initialize the stack. By accessing your Pulumi account after the initialization process you can check your new stack.

```bash
pulumi stack init python-eks-testing
```

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-9.19.10-AM-1024x605.png)

Set the AWS region where the stack is to be deployed.

```bash
pulumi config set aws:region <aws-region>
```

Issue the following command so that pulumi generates the deployment plan. If everything looks good to you, select _yes_ and wait for the stack to be deployed‚åõ.

```bash
pulumi up
```

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-8.24.29-PM-1024x706.png)

Update your local kubeconfig so that you can access the new cluster.

```bash
aws eks --region <aws-region> update-kubeconfig --name $(pulumi stack output cluster-name)
```

And voil√†, the cluster was created successfully!

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-10.07.22-PM-1024x146.png)

Once you're done playing with the cluster, destroy the infrastructure and the stack. Check wether the resources to be destroyed match the previously created ones. By issuing _deactivate_, your Python virtual environment will be deactivated.

```bash
pulumi destroy
pulumi stack rm python-eks-testing
deactivate
```

* * *

### GCP‚òÅÔ∏è¬†üåà

Similar to what was done in the example before, GCP credentials need to be configured so that they can be used by Pulumi. You can use [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs#install_the_latest_cloud_tools_version_cloudsdk_current_version) to set the credentials up. By issuing the following commands, you can set your credentials using a web interface and authenticate using the gcloud SDK.

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project <project-name>
gcloud auth application-default login
```

The snippet below shows the contents of **\_\_main\_\_.py** which can be found in the examples repository [within this path](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/gcp-py-gke). This python file creates a GKE (GCP's managed Kubernetes) cluster and deploys an nginx canary deployment. To do so, it generates a Kubeconfig (k8s\_config) which allows Pulumi to deploy resources into the cluster.

```python
from pulumi import Config, export, get_project, get_stack, Output, ResourceOptions
from pulumi_gcp.config import project, zone
from pulumi_gcp.container import Cluster, get_engine_versions
from pulumi_kubernetes import Provider
from pulumi_kubernetes.apps.v1 import Deployment
from pulumi_kubernetes.core.v1 import Service
from pulumi_random import RandomPassword

config = Config(None)

NODE_COUNT = config.get('node_count') or 3
NODE_MACHINE_TYPE = config.get('node_machine_type') or 'n1-standard-1'
USERNAME = config.get('username') or 'admin'
PASSWORD = config.get_secret('password') or RandomPassword("password", length=20, special=True).result
MASTER_VERSION = config.get('master_version')

k8s_cluster = Cluster('gke-cluster',
    initial_node_count=NODE_COUNT,
    node_version=MASTER_VERSION,
    min_master_version=MASTER_VERSION,
    master_auth={ 'username': USERNAME, 'password': PASSWORD },
    node_config={
        'machine_type': NODE_MACHINE_TYPE,
        'oauth_scopes': [
            'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute',
            'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only',
            'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write',
            'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring'
        ],
    },
)

k8s_info = Output.all(k8s_cluster.name, k8s_cluster.endpoint, k8s_cluster.master_auth)
k8s_config = k8s_info.apply(
    lambda info: """apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: {0}
    server: https://{1}
  name: {2}
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: {2}
    user: {2}
  name: {2}
current-context: {2}
kind: Config
preferences: {{}}
users:
- name: {2}
  user:
    auth-provider:
      config:
        cmd-args: config config-helper --format=json
        cmd-path: gcloud
        expiry-key: '{{.credential.token_expiry}}'
        token-key: '{{.credential.access_token}}'
      name: gcp
""".format(info[2]['clusterCaCertificate'], info[1], '{0}_{1}_{2}'.format(project, zone, info[0])))

k8s_provider = Provider('gke_k8s', kubeconfig=k8s_config)

labels = { 'app': 'canary-{0}-{1}'.format(get_project(), get_stack()) }
canary = Deployment('canary',
    spec={
        'selector': { 'matchLabels': labels },
        'replicas': 1,
        'template': {
            'metadata': { 'labels': labels },
            'spec': { 'containers': [{ 'name': 'nginx', 'image': 'nginx' }] },
        },
    }, __opts__=ResourceOptions(provider=k8s_provider)
)

ingress = Service('ingress',
    spec={
        'type': 'LoadBalancer',
        'selector': labels,
        'ports': [{'port': 80}],
    }, __opts__=ResourceOptions(provider=k8s_provider)
)

export('kubeconfig', k8s_config)
export('ingress_ip', Output.all(ingress.status['load_balancer']['ingress'][0]['ip']))
```

Prepare the Python environment and initialize the stack as you did in the example before.

```bash
cd ../gcp-py-gke
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pulumi stack init python-gke-testing
```

This example uses some variables that need to be set before generating the deployment plan. In order to do so, _pulumi config set_ command can be used. **Keep in mind that your password needs to be at least 16 characters long**!

```bash
pulumi config set gcp:project <gcp-project>
pulumi config set gcp:zone <gcp-zone>
pulumi config set password --secret <cluster-password>
pulumi config set master_version <master-version>
```

Once the required variables are set, you can generate the deployment plan and accept it.

```bash
 pulumi up
```

If you login to your Pulumi account after creating the infrastructure, you will be able to check the different resources that were created, as well as the outputs generated and variables defined for the stack.

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-2.31.55-PM-1024x298.png)

The kubeconfig created in the code is accesible as a Pulumi output. However it is stored as a ciphered output in the stack, so you will need the _\--show-secrets_ flag to decode itüîê.

```bash
pulumi stack output kubeconfig --show-secrets > kubeconfig.yaml
```

Using this Kubeconfig, you will be able to access the cluster using _kubectl_, and check that the canary deployment is present.

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-3.00.38-PM.png)

As before, once you finish testing the cluster, destroy the resources, the Pulumi stack and deactivate the Python virtual environment.

```bash
pulumi destroy
pulumi stack rm python-gke-testing
deactivate
```

* * *

### Azure‚òÅÔ∏èüî∑

The examples repository provides a [similar example](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-py-aks) to the ones shown before with the Azure managed Kubernetes service (AKS). However, I'm sure you have gotten the general idea by now üòâ¬†, so If you're really interested in testing it, feel free to follow the instructions in the repository and create an AKS cluster.

* * *

## Pulumi and Kubernetes‚ò∏Ô∏è

Last but not least, Pulumi can directly interact with Kubernetes clusters  
(managed as well as self-hosted ones) in order to deploy applications and resources. The code below creates a [simple nginx deployment](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/kubernetes-py-nginx) in Kubernetes using Python.

```python
import pulumi
from pulumi_kubernetes.apps.v1 import Deployment

config = pulumi.Config()
nginxLabels = { "app": "nginx" }
nginxDeployment = Deployment(
    "nginx-deployment", 
    spec={
        "selector": { "matchLabels": nginxLabels },
        "replicas": 2 if config.get_int("replicas") is None else config.get_int("replicas"),
        "template": {
            "metadata": { "labels": nginxLabels },
            "spec": {
                "containers": [{
                    "name": "nginx",
                    "image": "nginx:1.7.9",
                    "ports": [{ "containerPort": 80 }],
                }],
            },
        },
    })

pulumi.export("nginx", nginxDeployment.metadata["name"])
```

To interact with the cluster you will only need to set your _KUBECONFIG_ variable to the path of the Kubeconfig of the cluster to use. Once you have set it, execute the following commands to get the stack deployed.

```bash
cd ../kubernetes-py-nginx
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pulumi stack init python-k8s-testing
pulumi up
```

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-4.23.19-PM.png)

If you inspect the pods and deployments in your cluster, you will see that the resources were created as expected by Pulumi.

![](images/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-4.24.09-PM.png)

Clean everything up once you're done!

```bash
pulumi destroy
pulumi stack rm python-k8s-testing
deactivate
```
